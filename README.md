# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Introduction

This projects is the almagation of several solutions I have created to solve questions surrounding Data Structures and Algorithms. Having known how important Computer Science Fundamentals are to Software Development, I have made it a priority to have applicable knowledge of these concepts.

This project focuses on how applying different patterns and ways of solving the same problems with different, more efficient solutions can affect the Big O of algorithms - both in Space and Time. This project also takes an Object Oriented Programming approach when creating solutions i.e. creating Classes which own several methods, from which Objects can be instantiated as opposed to stand-alone, interconnected functions and variables.

## Technologies
